<div id="body-box">

        <p>Sidebar 300px</p>
        <p>Column 1</p>
    </div>
    <div id="column-2">
        <p>Content Remaining Width</p>
        <p>Column 2</p>
        <p>In this example, I am allowing the content to determine the size of the columns.
            I have not set column heights.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>Both columns are filling out the entire height of their flex container, regardless
            of what is being put in them.
        </p>
        <p>Even when I took away the definied height of the "body-box" container in css, both 
            columns grew at the same rate when I added more to just this one. The only way I was able
            to get different heights was to specify them in the css for each column. This may possibly
            be due to my usage of the following line of code for the first column:
        </p>
        <p>flex: 0 0 300px;</p>
        <p>I used this line of code to set the width of column one at 300px and not allow
            it to shrink or expand, since we were told to keep it at 300px.
